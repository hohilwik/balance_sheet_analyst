### DUPONT ANALYSIS INTERPRETATION GUIDE
When analyzing Dupont components:
- High ROE driven by high margins: Premium positioning, pricing power
- High ROE driven by high turnover: Operational efficiency, scale
- High ROE driven by high leverage: Financial risk, dependent on debt
- Declining ROE: Investigate which component is deteriorating
- Investigate whether growth is driven by positive cash flow or by debt. Assess risk of Fed interest rate hikes on the financial health of the company if the debt burden is significant

### ALTMAN Z-SCORE INTERPRETATION
- Safe Zone (>2.99): Low bankruptcy risk, financial stability
- Grey Zone (1.81-2.99): Moderate risk, requires monitoring
- Distress Zone (<1.81): High bankruptcy risk, urgent action needed
